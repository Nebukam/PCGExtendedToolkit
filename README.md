# PCG Extended Toolkit 

![PCGEx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nebukam/PCGExtendedToolkit/refs/heads/docs/_sources/smol-logo.png)

# What is it?
### The PCG Extended Toolkit is a plugin for [Unreal engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/) (5.6, + LTS on 5.5, 5.4, 5.3) that contains a collection of **low-level PCG Graph elements** offering additional ways to manipulate and control PCG Data in unique ways. Its primary focus is to create spatial relationships between points, and build around them; but it comes with a bunch of other super useful stuffs.

PCGEx allows you to create edge-based structures from points dataset, inside of which you can do pathfinding to generate splines; relax positions, attributes, flag specific types of connections, and much much more. 
It also comes with a set of lower-level, more generic features to manipulate attributes & points; as well as highly granular parameters & tweaks.

# Highlights
### Graph theory with Vtx/Edge structures
A new concept of connection between points, enabling entierely new ways of working with PCG

### Pathfinding
Advanced pathfinding utilities with a completely modular heuristics system

### Sampling
Powerful tool to extract, transfer and blend data between groups of points, splines, meshes

### Path Manipulation
Extensive toolset focusing on path manipulation & modification

### Tensors & vector fields
A very easy to use toolset to create & work with tensors, allowing to transform points & extrude paths using spatial effectors

### Low level utilities
A lot of simple yet powerful utility nodes ranging from complex sorting, complex partitioning, remapping, advanced filters with chainable conditions, to bitmask operations.

#### *And so much more -- PCGEx has 180+ nodes!*

# Interops
PCGEx has a few additional interops plugins to interfaces with "other things":

— **[PCGEx + Zone Graph](https://github.com/Nebukam/PCGExtendedToolkitZoneGraph)**  
— **[PCGEx + Watabou](https://github.com/Nebukam/PCGExtendedToolkitWatabou)**
