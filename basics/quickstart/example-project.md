# Example Project

The example project is the best place to get a visual sense of all the features that can have some sort of visual expression to them.

The content is divided into two main parts:

* Showroom (**Categories**), focuses on showcasing individual node without much context — in other words, it's very abstract.
* **Examples**, on the other end, showcases how some nodes can work together to produce more complex and intricate results. They're still very barebone because there's no "assets" in the project.

## Getting the example project

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Download the project files

<a href="https://github.com/Nebukam/PCGExExampleProject/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" class="button primary">Download the ZIP</a>  or to to the <a href="https://github.com/Nebukam/PCGExExampleProject" class="button primary">GitHub repo</a>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Install PCGEx

Make sure you have PCGEx installed!\
The project itself has the plugin enabled in the settings, **however it does not have the source embedded.** Head over to [Installation](installation.md) if you haven't already.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Open the project & dive in!

That's pretty much all there is about it.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="success" %}
The example project has a lot of "utilitary" subgraphs that handle boilerplate tasks — **these are not part of the plugin itself**, they just exist to make my life easier when making examples with a consistent format and avoid cluttering the graphs with that shouldn't be the focus.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note that **the example project is only maintained for the latest version of the engine**. If you're interested in older version, they are preserved in their own branch on git and do not represent the breadth of what's available on latest.
{% endhint %}
